### A Crowdfunding dapp which has the following functionalities:
- Manager sets the target amount initially along with the deadline for which the contract will accept contributions.
- Contributors can send ethers to the contract address (the minimum amount required for the transaction to complete is 100 Wei). They can withdraw the amount if the contribution deadline exceeds and the target is not met.
- Manager can create requests for which the funds will be used, these requests can be voted by the contributors to approve the request.
- A request is only approved if it receives at least 50% contributor votes, and the funds are transferred to the target amount on approval of the manager.
- Contract balance can be viewed by everyone.

The project is still under development ðŸ› . Open to suggestionsðŸ˜Š
